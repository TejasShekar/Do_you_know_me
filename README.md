# Quiz Game

This is a small game based on CLI where you can find out whether you know me.

# Installation

Even though I have included required dependencies along with the Javascript file, you might have issues running it on your terminal. So, I would recommend you to install the below dependencies incase you have issues running the JS file.

## Dependencies

Before running this program, run the following commands in terminal to install dependencies.

To read input from user :

```bash
npm install readline-sync
```

To add colors and styles in the terminal:

```bash
npm install chalk
```

## Usage

You should have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.
Then, in the directory of the index file, open terminal and run

```bash
node index.js
```

You can also run the same in your VS Code terminal as long as you are in the directory of the folder.
