# Quiz Game

This is a small game based on CLI where you can find out whether you know me.

You can directly play the game by clicking on the link provided in the about section of this repository or follow the instructions below to play it locally on your system resources.

## Installation

Even though I have included required dependencies along with the Javascript file, you may have issues running it on your terminal. So, I would recommend you to install the below dependencies, incase you have issues running the JS file.

## Dependencies

Before running this program,

We will need 
1. readlinesync - to read input from user.
2. chalk - to add colors and styles in the terminal

You can install them by running the following commands in your terminal.
```bash
npm install readline-sync chalk
```

## Usage

You should have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.
Then, in the directory of the index file, open terminal and run

```bash
node index.js
```

You can also run the same in your VS Code terminal as long as you are in the directory of the folder.
